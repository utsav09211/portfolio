[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/3ffe71b5-c404-4b2c-83a3-ca0db6cb14e0/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/cade/deploys)

My personal website I created using Gatsby, React and Netlify. [Check it out!](https://cade.codes)

## Features
I used the [`gatsby-transformer-json`](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-transformer-json/) Gatsby plugin to query the data for the site from the json folder in `/src/` and then build the site accordingly.

I was experimenting the the CSS property [`mixed-blend-mode`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/mix-blend-mode) to give the SVG's and the text on the side bars a cool color change effect when you scroll between each section.

Netlify has some awesome features including automatic SSL encryption, continuous deployment, and form handling. I used their free form submission features and it was quick and intuitive with no server setup required. You can even use their form submission with a fetch request so there are no redirects.

Building this site was a great opportunity to become more familiar with React hooks so I implemented them wherever I could.
